# simpleweather

That progam is not finished, i'm working on it still,
there will be few updates like divide GUILauncher to few constructors, few more design, last step will be added the multithreading.


That program is a simple weather program who will give you current temperature and other information about weather in Poland, it required just enter a Poland zip code.

You can run it with Exe.java - program will start automatically.
